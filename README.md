# Timer50yen
A lightweight, basic timer with some added functionalities for the terminal

## Description
This project aims to create a **lightweight** timer that can run in the terminal. The intended features of the timer include the following:
- (*in progress*) Stopwatch
    - Count up in seconds
    - Lap timing
    - Reset capability
    - (*TBD*) Difference in time between laps
- (*future*) Timer
    - Count down from specified time
        - Format of either HH:MM:SS (e.g. 1:30:00) or XhYmZs (e.g. 1h30m)
    - Alert when time has expired
        - Customisable sound

There is no reason to use this over any other timer/stopwatch application/package, this project exists for the purpose of learning C++.
